# ERC-4337 Project  
  
### Introduction  
Our project aims to create an SDK that can make it easier for developers to make Web3 accessible to the world in a much more user-friendly way. We aim to be able to integrate social logins with a smart contract wallet directly, without having to use any middleware.
